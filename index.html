						<h3><b>About Me</b></h3>
						<h6 class="font-lite-black"><b>Human on the internet.
              <br> Raised in Hawaii,
              <br> Lives in Brooklyn,
              <br> Servant Leader CTO</b></h6>

				<div class="col-sm-8">
					<p class="margin-b-30">Hello! I'm Jude. I grew up in the rural wilds
            of Hawaii where by day we built our homestead and by night we
            played computer games on generator power.</p>
          
          <p class="margin-b-30">As a teenager, I apprenticed with NASA at 
            Georgia Tech and thoroughly had my interest piqued in engineering.
            I went on to pursue a B.S. and M.S. in Computer Science from CU Boulder,
            and along the way jumped into just about every club and research project I could find.
            By graduation, I'd produced research papers about wireless networks between micro-aerial vehicles,
            computer science educational pedagogy, and computational fluid dynamics.
          </p>
          <p class="margin-b-30"> They gave me an award! It was very nice of them. I was the 
            distinguished graduate for Service for the college of Engineering and Applied Science in 2009.
            Following graduation, I went on to join Fog Creek Software as a Member of Technical Staff
            and commenced my personal odyssey in software development.
          </p>
          <p class="margin-b-30">Fog Creek, in its early days, was known for its blog-- Joel On Software.
            As a small bootstrapped software company in NYC, it went on to create Stack Overflow (in partnership with Jeff Atwood),
            Trello, and Glitch. I began as an Intern in 2008 and rose to CTO, and saw the company through
            many grand adventures (check my CV for more details). At the end of 2018, Fog Creek came to a close;
            Fog Creek is now Glitch Inc., a startup oriented around its new product and putting down the grand
            experiment that was Fog Creek Software.
          </p>
          <p class="margin-b-30">  
            And so I return to Ithaca (metaphorically speaking... I live in Brooklyn.) and keep an eye to the horizon
            for any tall ships passing through.
          </p>

                I spoke on techniques for scaling servant leadership at CTO School in 2016. Although I don't have the original, I repeated the talk at my office and it is <b>
                <a href="https://medium.com/make-better-software/scaling-servant-leadership-faaad3fc88e2">recorded and transcribed here</a>

              </p>
						<p class="font-semi-white margin-tb-30">I have a tendency to make and give talks, sometimes to large crowds.  I picked up the habit in college as an Engineering Fellow, Microsoft Student Partner, and President of the Game Development club.
              Most recently, I've given a lightning talk at Strange Loop, presented to CTO School on Servant Leadership, 
              and presented dozens of times internally at Fog Creek and Trello.
