						<h3><b>About Me</b></h3>
						<h6 class="font-lite-black"><b>Human on the internet.
              <br> Raised in Hawaii,
              <br> Lives in Brooklyn,
              <br> Servant Leader CTO </b></h6>
					</div>

				<div class="col-sm-8">
					<p class="margin-b-30">Hello! I'm Jude. I grew up in the rural wilds
            of Hawaii where by day we built our homestead and by night we
            played computer games on generator power.</p>
          
          <p class="margin-b-30">As a teenager, I apprenticed with <b>NASA</b> at 
            Georgia Tech and thoroughly had my interest piqued in engineering.
            I went on to pursue a <b>B.S. and M.S. in Computer Science from CU Boulder</b>,
            and along the way jumped into just about every club and research project I could find.
            By graduation, I'd produced research papers about wireless networks between micro-aerial vehicles,
            computer science educational pedagogy, and computational fluid dynamics.
          </p>
          <p class="margin-b-30"> They gave me an award! It was very nice of them. I was the 
            <b>Distinguished Graduate for Service</b> for the college of Engineering and Applied Science in 2009.
            Following graduation, I went on to join <b>Fog Creek Software</b> as a Member of Technical Staff
            and commenced my personal odyssey in software development.
          </p>
          <p class="margin-b-30">Fog Creek in its early days was known for its blog-- Joel On Software.
            As a small bootstrapped software company in NYC, it went on to create <b>Stack Overflow</b> (in partnership with Jeff Atwood),
            <b>Trello</b>, and <b>Glitch</b>. I began as an Intern in 2008 and rose to CTO, and saw the company through
            many grand adventures. At the end of 2018, Fog Creek came to a close;
            Fog Creek is now Glitch Inc., a startup oriented around its new product and putting down the grand
            experiment that was Fog Creek Software. I suppose that makes me <b>Fog Creek's Alumni CTO</b>.
          </p>
          <p class="margin-b-30">  
            I became a tech founder in 2019 when I teamed up with <a href="https://twitter.com/nonparibus">@nonparibus</a> to build 
            <a href="https://hash.ai">HASH</a>, a revolutionary (and open source!) platform for advanced data modeling and simulation.
            Joining as <b>Co-Founder & CTO at HASH</b>, I worked to architect and build the first version of the <b><a href="https://hash.ai">
            HASH Simulation Engine and IDE</a></b>.
            Armed with our prototype and business plan, we ran the Silicon Valley VC Gauntlet and raised Seed 
            funding sufficient to scale us upwards and onwards towards our Series A. In the next few months we quintupled the size 
            of our engineering team, launched a private beta that holiday season, and reoriented ourselves for a sprint toward
            public launch.
          </p>
          <p>
            Having laid the foundations of HASH's product and team, I continue on as 
            <b>Chief Technical Advisor</b> to HASH in support of their mission to bring general purpose simulation 
            as decision support to humans worldwide.

                I spoke on techniques for scaling servant leadership at CTO School in 2016. Although I don't have the original, I repeated the talk at my office and it is <b>
                <a href="https://medium.com/make-better-software/scaling-servant-leadership-faaad3fc88e2">recorded and transcribed here</a>

						<p class="font-semi-white margin-tb-30">I have a tendency to make and give talks, sometimes to large crowds.  I picked up the habit in college as an Engineering Fellow, Microsoft Student Partner, and President of the CU Game Development Club.
              Most recently, I've given a lightning talk at Strange Loop, presented to CTO School on Servant Leadership, 
              and presented dozens of times internally at Fog Creek and Trello.
