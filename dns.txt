Glitch DNS configuration:

CNAME  @    l3p747dmuzf7opgj.shw.io.
^^ disable this one if we want mail to work... which we do.
..so instead we use an A: pointed at 206.51.242.1

CNAME  www  glnym2lwtkfgznre.shw.io.


...why is this text file here?
- Because Glitch gives us these url's once, and then we can't find them again if we misplace them...  so they're stored here.
